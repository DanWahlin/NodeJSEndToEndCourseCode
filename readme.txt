To create the lab code do the following:

1. Copy the final source code for the app into the Src folder.
2. Make a copy of the Code folder (VERY IMPORTANT!!!)
3. Run node copyFolders.js to generate the lab code output.
4. Delete node_modules, copyFolders.js, package.son, and readme.txt before generating the .zip.
